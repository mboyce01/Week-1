  	<h4> My Background
  	</h4>
  	<p>I attended Saint Mary's College in Notre Dame, IN where I earned a degree in Marketing & Finance.  After college, I spent two years in investment banking at a boutique bank focused on the food industry.  I recently accepted a position with Accenture.  I am in sales and marketing and love it so far!
  	</p>
  	<p>My experience in web design is limited, but my passion is endless.  I am working hard to make up for lost time and learn as much as possible while in the Starter League!  My ultimate goal is to leave the Starter League and be able to build websites for small businesses in my "free time".

  	<h4> <i>Personal Life</i>
  	</h4>
  	<p><i>I grew up in the Southwestern suburbs of Chicago.  I am the youngest of six kids and love being around my family.  I have one brother, Danny, and four sisters: Katie, Bridget, Eileen, and Annie.  We are fortunate to still live near each other in the suburbs of Chicago.</i>
